Using Random forest for binary classification predicting whether it is benign or malignant 
Accuracy on testing data = 93%

Credit card fraud detection:

As the dataset is imbalanced to balance it undersampling and oversampling was done.Acquired 99% accuracy on using Random Forest Classifier on oversampled dataset.The random forest classifier model was saved used jobfile library so make easier predictions

Spam mail prediction:

Implemented Tfifvectorizer to convert text data(mail data) into numerical values. Achieved an accuracy of 97% on using SVM
